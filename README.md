## Hello! 👋 I am Sreetama.

I'm a physicist interested in all types of data, finding patterns in them, and identifying problems to solve them efficiently. I like to weave an interesting story out of complex data and present it with clear, vivid visualization. 

###  🔭 I’m currently working on
- Python (my daily companion)
- Statistics, modeling, and data exploration  
- Finding order and patterns in chaotic data

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- More of statistics and applications
- Deep Learning methods
