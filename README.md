## Hello! 👋 I am Sreetama.


I'm a physicist interested in all types of data, finding patterns in them, and identifying problems to solve them efficiently. I like to weave an interesting story out of complex data and present it with clear, vivid visualization. 

###  🔭 I’m currently working on
- Python (my daily companion)
- Statistics, modeling, and data exploration  
- Finding order and patterns in chaotic data

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- More of statistics and applications
- Deep Learning methods

### 🎯 Currently Exploring
I’m transitioning from the world of physics, have searched for "ghostly particles", the neutrinos, towards broader applications of  **data science and analytics**, building projects with data beyond physics. Lately, I’ve been brushing up on statistics, diving deep into AI/ML, and looking for interesting projects to dive into.
